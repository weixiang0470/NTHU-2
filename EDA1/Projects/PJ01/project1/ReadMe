# Project 1 - Dynamic Programming for TSP

## Environment Setup
Before compiling and running the project, you need to ensure that a C++17-compatible `g++` compiler is available. You can activate `g++` from `devtoolset-9` by running the following command:

```bash
source scl_source enable devtoolset-9
```
## Example Executable
An example solution, example_proj1, is provided for reference. You can execute it using the following command:

```bash
./example_proj1 <input> <output>
```
For example:

```bash
./example_proj1 ./testcases/case0.in ./output/case0.out
```

This will read the input graph from case0.in, solve the TSP using dynamic programming, and write the result to case0.out.

## Compiling and Running the Project
### Running
Run the following command to compile and execute your program:

```bash
./run.sh <studentID_name_proj1>
```

Replace `<studentID_name_proj1>` with your actual student ID and name, e.g., `111000111_Mark_proj1`.

The script will:
1. Compile `main.cpp` using `make`, producing an executable named according to your student ID and name.
2. Run the compiled program on all test cases located in the `testcases/` folder.

## Makefile Usage
The `Makefile` is used for compiling the project. It is invoked automatically by `run.sh`, but if you want to compile manually, run:

```bash
make TARGET=<studentID_name_proj1>
```

where `<studentID_name_proj1>` is your student ID and name.

## Completing Your Assignment
Please complete your implementation inside `main.cpp`. Your program should:
- Read the input graph from the `.in` files (`testcases/` folder).
- Write the ouput results to the `.out` files (`output/` folder).
- Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Dynamic Programming.
- Print the ordering of cities for TSP and total distance.


## Submission Instructions
Please execute the following command:

```bash
./tar.sh <studentID>
```

This will generate a compressed file `<studentID>.tar.gz` in the current directory. Please upload this file to **eeclass**.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask TA.
